# Learning Scala

The repository contains testing classes and exercises done during various Scala courses and learning.

- [LogicalFucntions](src/main/scala/com/davidlukac/learn/scala/LogicalFunctions.scala)
   - implementation of `and` and `or` using Call-by-Name feature on the 2nd argument to optimise result calculation.
- [MathFunctions](src/main/scala/com/davidlukac/learn/scala/MathFunctions.scala)
  - Implementation of `SQRT` function using Newton's approximation method.
  - Searching for specific digits in given range of numbers.

I cover most of the functionality with `FunSuite` test from [ScalaTest](http://www.scalatest.org).
